# Cine-Bot-
We developed a fully automated Cinema management system named as CineBot using C++ Object oriented principles in which user can buy tickets from their ease using mobile phones. They can choose the movie they want to watch, the seat of the hall and time slots available for the movie. After purchasing ticket they are issued with a unique verification id which can be used to check their status of ticket and be used to verify you by another system fixed at the entrance of the cinema. You will be verified there and will be allowed by the system to watch the movie at your derived place and time. The users who had purchased the tickets more than 3 times were given 10% discount. Users will see the reserved seat in the graphical view of the Cinema hall. Login/Sign up panel was made for the customer users and for admins there was a single admin who can change admin controls and can add, change the movies with their further details.
